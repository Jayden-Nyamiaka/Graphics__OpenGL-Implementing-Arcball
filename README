Compile and Execute Instructions:

    1) The code has 3 executables that can be generated from the Makefile: 
            - opengl (the Quarternion Implementation of ArcBall)
            - opengl_matrix (the Matrix Implementation of ArcBall)
            - demo (the original Demo that lets you move around with wasd)

    2) Run "make all" to generate the executable that runs OpenGL with the Quarternion Implementation of ArcBall.

    3) Run ./opengl [scene_description_file.txt] [xres] [yres] to have that scene open in OpenGL.

    4) Run "make clean" to delete any generated files.
