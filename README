Compile and Execute Instructions:
    1) Running "make all" compiles everything the code needs to run.
    2) Run "make run" to generate 800 by 800 pixels ppm images.
        - Appropriate ppm files are created within the data folder.
        - The ppm images can also print to Standard Out via Wireframe::output(true).
        - Rendering progress is printed via cerr (can be turned off via Wirefame::plot(false)).
    3) The ppm3-to-png.py file from the last project is still there.
        - More info can be found in the ppm3-to-png.py file.
        - Run "make generate_pngs" to produce pngs from any generated ppms.
        - Conversion sometimes may not work if the supplied image is too big.
    4) Run "make clean" to delete any generated files.

Some Other Things to Note:
    I tried to speed up the rendering as much as possible with some other optimizations.
    For Gouraud vs Phong Shading, Object has shading-type specific fields that are by default
    empty and only touched within Wireframe. These fields are malloced arrays to generate faster
    render speeds, which can be done since the size / dimensions are defined before use.
    Please, let me know if there are more things that could be done to increase run speeds.
    I really tried my best to optimize without losing readability, so I would be interested to
    know what other strategies exist for code optimization in graphics.
